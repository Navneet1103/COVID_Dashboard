Created a voila dashboard using COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.
Performed ETL on COVID-19 dataset and created Interactive Visuals using python libraries and deployed the web app on Heroku.
Enable users to specifically see the current scenario of the coronavirus in their country, show parameters like mortality rate of the country, topmost affected countries, and their current count, and showing the virus spread on the world map.
